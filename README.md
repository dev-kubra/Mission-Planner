# Mission Planner UI

Mission Planner UI is a defense style mission planning dashboard built to practice modern frontend development with real world patterns.

This project focuses on building a map based interface (mission view) and a control panel (telemetry, waypoints) similar to systems used in mission planning and operational monitoring.

# Goal
My main goal is not just to finish a project, but to deeply understand the architecture and build this type of application independently.

# Why I’m building this
I’m building this project to improve my skills in:
- building map-based user interfaces
- managing global state for mission data
- creating a scalable component architecture
- designing clean and responsive UI layouts

# Tech Stack
- React + Vite -> fast development & component-based UI
- Leaflet + React-Leaflet -> interactive map rendering and mission visualization
- Zustand -> simple and scalable global state management
- Tailwind CSS -> clean UI and responsive layout building

# Planned Features (MVP)
- Map view with a moving UAV/vehicle marker
- Route drawing (Polyline)
- Waypoint management (add / remove)
- Telemetry panel (speed, altitude, status)
